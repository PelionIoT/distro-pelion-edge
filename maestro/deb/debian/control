Description: systems management for Pelion Edge OS
 Maestro is a replacement for a number of typical system utilities and
 management programs, while providing cloud-connected systems
 management. Maestro is designed specifically for cloud-connected
 embedded Linux computers, with somewhat limited RAM and disk space,
 where file systems are often flash - and would prefer less writing
 over time.
