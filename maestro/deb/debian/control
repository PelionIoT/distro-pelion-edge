Description: system manager (logging, dhcp, cloud connector)
 Maestro is a replacement for a number of typical system utilities and
 management programs, while providing cloud-connected systems management.
 Maestro is designed specifically for cloud-connected embedded Linux computers,
 with somewhat limited RAM and disk space, where file systems are often flash -
 and would prefer less writing over time.
