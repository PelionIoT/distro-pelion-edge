# Build scripts for Pelion Edge

The  folder `build-env`  contains helper  or common  scripts. Other  directories
contain build scripts specific for each package, for Debian-based distributions:
```
<package name>/deb/build.sh
metapackages/<package name>/deb/build.sh
```
and for RedHat-based distributions:
```
<package name>/rpm/build.sh
```

The build scripts `build.sh`  or `build-env/bin/build-all.sh` can build packages
directly on supported  systems or in docker container. The  docker container can
be launched manually, for example as an interactive session, or the scripts will
run docker automatically if the argument `--docker` is provided.

It  is recommended  to use  docker  since it  will provide  a clean  environment
without interference with local user settings  (for example, with user nodejs or
python environments) and does not require setting up local packages repository.

Also, the build will need `sudo` privileges to install standard Ubuntu packages.

## Quickstart
First make sure your system is configured correctly (see [requirements](#requirements))

Here's how to quickly build Pelion Edge Packages for Ubuntu Focal amd64.

1. Prepare `mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c` and `update_default_resources.c`
files:
```bash
# copy your mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c file in place so that the edge devmode package will build with your dev credentials
cp ~/Downloads/mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c .
# use manifest tool to create an update_default_resources.c so that you'll be ready to perform an over-the-air-update
# copy the generated update_default_resources.c into place
cp /path/to/update_default_resources.c .
```

2. Run build scripts:
```bash
# build all the Ubuntu 20 packages for amd64 using docker container
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh focal ./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --deps --install --build --source --arch=amd64
# deb packages will be available in ./build/deploy/deb/focal/main/


# then if you'd like to rebuild an individual package (ex: mbed-edge-core-devmode)
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh focal ./mbed-edge-core-devmode/deb/build.sh --install --build --source --arch=amd64
```

Alternative way to run build scripts:

```bash
# build all the Ubuntu 20 packages for amd64 using docker container
./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --docker=focal --deps --install --build --source --arch=amd64
# deb packages will be available in ./build/deploy/deb/focal/main/


# then if you'd like to rebuild an individual package (ex: mbed-edge-core-devmode)
./mbed-edge-core-devmode/deb/build.sh --docker=focal --install --build --source --arch=amd64
```

## Build environment

To access  build environment console `docker-run-env.sh`  script was introduced.
The script accepts options until first positional argument (which is environment
name).

Example usage:
```bash
# run new rhel/8 image for host arch:
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh rhel

# run centos container (attach to existing)
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh -c centos

# run 'ls' in centos container
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh -c centos ls

# run fresh container (and allow later attaching to it)
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh -c clean centos ls

# recreate docker image and container and run shell in new container
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh -r -c clean centos

# run new arm64 container
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh -c=clean -a arm64 centos
```

The  above script  also creates  docker images  with build  essentials and  with
additional packages  required for generating  source packages (for  example git,
npm, python) depending on selected environment.

To  add prefix  to docker  images and  containers export  `PELION_DOCKER_PREFIX`
variable in your shell with your prefix:
```
export PELION_DOCKER_PREFIX=${USER}-
```

The system in docker image is configured to use `sudo` without a password.

The root of this repo is mounted to `/pelion-build`.

To get list of all supported target distributions, run:
```bash
./build-env/bin/build-all.sh -l env
```

It is  not required to  specify full  name of environment  (eg. `ubuntu/focal`).
Partial, unique match would also work (like in quickstart example: `focal`).

## Building a single package

Dependency packages must be built prior to building a single package.
```bash
./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --deps --install --docker=<dist>
```
or
```bash
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh <dist> ./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --deps --install
```

### Build single package for Debian and Ubuntu
The build scripts provide help information, for example:

```
$ maestro/deb/build.sh --help
Usage: maestro/deb/build.sh [Options]

Options:
 --docker=<dist>     Use docker containers (dist can be focal, bionic, buster...).
 --source            Generate source package.
 --build             Build binary from source generated with --source option.
 --verify            Verify package conformity to the Debian policy.
 --install           Install build dependencies.
 --arch=<arch>       Set target architecture.
 --help,-h           Print this message.

 If none of '--source', '--build' or '--verify' options are specified,
 all of them are activated.

Available architectures:
  amd64
  arm64
  armhf

Default mode: maestro/deb/build.sh --arch=amd64 --source --build --verify
```

These scripts can be used to generate both source and binary packages.

It is possible to  use these scripts without the option  `--docker` if docker is
run manually by  `docker-run-env.sh`. The option `--docker` will  make all tasks
run in appropriate containers automatically (using source of build images):

### Build single package for RedHat and Centos
The build scripts for RPM-based distributions are similar to Debian's:

```
$ ./maestro/rpm/build.sh --help
build.sh - builds maestro RPM package

Usage: build.sh [-h|--help] [--install]
 -h, --help                 display this help message.
 -i, --install              install dependencies
 -b, --build                build package
 -s, --source               prepare sources
 -d, --docker=<name>        use docker container to build RPM
 -a, --arch=<name>          build for selected architecture
 -c, --container=[opts]     reuse container; opts can be (comma separated):
                            - clean - create new container before first use
 -r, --recreate             forcibly recreate docker images (implies -c=clean)
 -o, --deploy=<path>        set target directory for RPMs

```

Additionally  these  scripts supports  Docker  image  creation when  needed  and
container re-usage.

## Building all packages

```
$ ./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --help
build-all.sh - build all packages:

USAGE: 
-a, --arch=<name>       run build for <name> architecture
-d, --docker=<name>     run build in docker (name=docker environment)
-h, --help              print this help text
-i, --install           install dependencies
-e, --print-env=[what]  print environment setup: packages, meta, deps
                        (deps packages)
-l, --print-list        print list: env (list of available environments)
-c, --container=[opts]  use one container per kind instead of container
                        per package; opts can be (comma separated):
                        - clean - create new container before first use
-r, --recreate          forcibly recreate docker images (implies -c=clean)

Build elements:
-b, --build             run build stage
-s, --source            run source stage
-t, --tar               run tarball creation stage
-p, --deps              run dependency compilation stage

When no -b, -s, -t or -p are set, all are enabled. Setting one of them will
disable unset parameters (eg. setting -b -s will run only source and build
stage).

If --docker is set, build process will run in new container. By adding --container
scripts will use one container to build all packages (instead of container
per package)
```

This script  will run build of  each package in new  docker container installing
all build dependencies each time (with `--docker` option), for example:
```
./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --docker=focal --arch=amd64,armhf,arm64
```

By adding `--container`  option, one container will be used  if possible. Adding
`--container clean` will remove existing container before build.

It  is  possible to  manually  run  docker and  then  build  everything in  this
container:
```
$ ./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh bionic
user@95a30883d637:/pelion-build$ ./build-env/bin/build-all.sh --install --arch=amd64
```

When   build   requires  different   architecture   to   build  natively   (when
cross-compilation is  not available,  like for Red  Hat) `--arch=<architecture>`
has to be added to `docker-run-env.sh` before specifying target environment:
```bash
./build-env/bin/docker-run-env.sh --arch arm64 rhel
```

The option `--install`  is required when the script is  executed in clear docker
container, otherwise it will fail due to missing build dependencies.

To  provide  build  dependency  use  `--deps` switch.  This  will  create  build
dependencies and  put into local repository.  This is enabled by  default if not
build/source/tar is set.

## Generating tar archives

Tar  archives  are now  generated  for  Debian  and  Ubuntu only. A  tar  archive
can  be  created  from a  binary  release  for  Debian.  One option  is  to  use
the  `build-all.sh` script  as  described  above. Another  option  is to  invoke
`build-env/bin/deb2tar.sh` directly.

```
$ build-env/bin/deb2tar.sh --help
deb2tar.sh - converts a set of Debian packages into a portable tarball.

Usage: deb2tar.sh [-h|--help] [-a ARCH|--arch ARCH]
 -h, --help
  Display this help message.
 -a ARCH, --arch ARCH		Set the host architecture of the tarball.
 -d DISTRO, --distro DISTRO Set Linux distro (eg. focal, buster...)
```

Before invoking `deb2tar.sh` make sure that all packages you want to be included
in the tarball are already built.

## Build results

The scripts create  or modify files only  in the `build` directory  that is also
created automatically.

There is a reusable git cache in the directory `build/downloads`.

Final Debian packages are created in `build/deploy/deb/<DISTRO>/main`, organized
in subdirectories per architecture:
* `binary-amd64`
* `binary-arm64`
* `binary-armhf`
* `source`

Tarballs can be found in `build/deploy/tar`, one archive per architecture.

Red Hat and Centos packages are created in `build/deploy/rpm/<DISTRO>`:
* source packages are on top of this directory
* `noarch`, `x86_64` and `aarch64` directories contains final packages

## Installing packages

Build results can be installed onto a target system either by manually
copying the packages to a target system and installing via apt or by
making the packages available in an APT repository on a server and installing
on the target via apt. The instructions in this section show how to install
the packages manually.  See the next section for setting up an APT repository.

Copy the debian packages found in `build/deploy/deb/` to the
target system and install with `apt`.

Install all packages with the following command.
```
$ sudo apt install -y ./*.deb
```

Or, install a single package by specifying its deb file name.
```
$ sudo apt install -y ./devicedb_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

## Removing packages

To remove use command:
```
$ sudo apt remove -y <package name> --autoremove --purge
```

After remove all package, manually remove credentials and config files:
```
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/pelion/
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/pelion/
```

## APT repository

Structure for APT repository server can be created in `build/deploy/deb/apt-repo`
directory by `build-env/bin/pelion-apt-repo-create.sh`. It provides help
information:

```
$ ./build-env/bin/pelion-apt-repo-create.sh --help
Usage: pelion-apt-repo-create.sh [Options]

Options:
 --key-name=<name>         Filename of secret GPG key.
 --key-[id|path]=<id|path> Use key id of existing GPG key or path where private key is placed.
 --install                 Installs the necessary tools to create structure for apt repository.
 --help,-h                 Print this message.

```

An APT repository and its contents have to  be signed with a GPG key.  There are
two ways to pass such a key to the  script: using an id of a key stored in one's
GPG keyring or a filesystem path to a secret key. The default is to use the file
`build/deploy/deb/gpg/Pelion_GPG_key_private.gpg`.

### GPG key pair generation

To generate a key pair one can use `build-env/bin/pelion-gpg-key-generate.sh`:
```
$ ./build-env/bin/pelion-gpg-key-generate.sh --help
Usage: pelion-gpg-key-generate.sh --key-email=<email> [Options]

Options:
 --key-name=<name>             Set name of GPG key and filename of public (<name>_public.gpg)
                               and private (<name>_private.gpg) keys.
 --key-email=<email>           Set email of GPG key.
 --key-path=<path>             Set path where public and private keys will be placed.
 --install                     Installs the necessary tools to generate the gpg key pair.
 --help,-h                     Print this message.

```

The `--key-email`  flag is required  (it's the email part  of a key's  id).  The
generated public  and private  keys will  be placed  into `build/deb/deploy/gpg`
directory by default, but this can be changed using the `--key-path` option.

### APT repository usage

In order to get access to an apt  repository add a line of the following form in
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:
```
deb [arch=amd64] http://<ip address> bionic main
```

Then import the GPG key the repository was signed with:
```
wget -q -O - http://<ip address>/key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
